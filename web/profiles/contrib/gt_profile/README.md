# Georgia Tech Profile Installations

This repository contains the installation scripts for the Georgia Tech profiles to be used in a Drupal website.

## Developer Profile
As the name suggests, this profile is for **advanced developers**. It's a near barren profile focused on maximizing flexibility and allowing for the creation of more custom, specialized websites. 

## Builder Profile
This standard middle-of-the-pack profile is great for site builders and managers. It comes pre-configured with a variety of useful modules and offers plenty of flexibility for general use cases.

## Communicator Profile
This is a **deluxe profile**, ideal for communicators. It includes an extensive array of modules including **Mercury Reader** and **Layout Builder**, and has a straightforward setup process with little user intervention. However, this profile offers the least flexibility and customization options.
